A few weeks ago, I was having the same argument with myself for the third time in 6 months:

    “Should I quit my job?”

Same frustration. Same doubts. Same inability to decide.

Then it hit me: I had zero memory of the pattern.

I couldn’t remember what helped me decide last time, what I learned, what worked, what didn’t.

My life was fragmented moments with no connective tissue.

So I spent 7 days straight building Egovex — an AI that actually remembers your entire context and uses it to help you make better decisions.

Spoiler: It already knows things about me I didn’t know about myself.
What it does (the non-BS version)

Instead of journaling into a void or chatting with generic AI, Egovex builds a

semantic graph of your existence:

    :studio_microphone: Voice notes when you’re processing thoughts

    :camera_with_flash: Photos of moments that matter

    :writing_hand: Text reflections when you need to think deeply

    :hourglass_not_done: Decisions you’re struggling with (tracked with deadlines)

Then the AI does something wild: it connects everything.

It notices when you mention the same frustration 4 times in a month.

It remembers that conversation you had 3 weeks ago.

It sees patterns you’re blind to.

Bonus: Fully native multilingual

(English, Spanish, French, Italian, German).

Building this was surprisingly easy thanks to how I structured the AI prompts.
Real conversation from my first week using it

    Me: “I’m procrastinating on this creative project again”

    Egovex:

    “This is the 4th time you’ve mentioned procrastination on creative work in 6 days.

    But look at this pattern:”

    (Shows timeline of my entries)

    Days you procrastinate:

    Always when you start work before 10am

    Days you don’t:

    When you work out first, then start after 11am

    “You’ve literally told me ‘felt focused today’ 3 times after morning workouts.

    Your brain needs movement before creativity.

    Did you know this about yourself?”

I didn’t.

But the data doesn’t lie.
The tech behind it (and how Replit made it possible)
Stack

    React frontend (built entirely in Replit)

    Node.js + Express backend

    OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini for conversation intelligence

    Vector embeddings for semantic search across all context types

    Replit Database for persistent storage (zero config needed)

Why Replit was absolutely critical

    Replit AI Assistant saved me 10+ hours

    At 2am on day 3, my vector similarity search was returning garbage when mixing voice transcripts with text.

    Replit AI spotted I wasn’t normalizing embedding dimensions consistently.

    Fixed in 5 minutes.

    Instant deployments = no context switching

    Code → deploy → test on phone → bug → fix → redeploy.

    Feedback loop under 2 minutes.

    This is how I shipped in 7 days instead of 7 weeks.

    Integrated database

    From “I need PostgreSQL or MongoDB”

    to “click button, get database” in 30 seconds.

    The environment just works

    No Docker. No configs. No “works on my machine” BS.

    90% built on laptop, 10% on phone when ideas hit randomly.

Hardest technical challenge

Making the AI feel genuinely personal.
My solution: a 3-layer context injection system
Layer 1: Semantic Search

    Every message triggers vector search across all past entries

    Retrieves top 5–10 most relevant moments

    Cross-modal (voice “stress” ↔ text “burnout”)

Layer 2: Contextual Weighting

Each memory is scored by:

    Recency (recent = more relevant)

    Emotional impact (sentiment analysis)

    Value alignment (relation to core values)

Layer 3: Transparent Citations

Every response shows why the AI says what it says:

    “Referencing your audio note from Dec 10th”

    “Similar to what you wrote on Nov 28th”

    “This conflicts with your value: Work-Life Balance”

Transparency is critical when you’re sharing intimate thoughts.
What makes this different from “just another AI journal”

I tested every AI journal app I could find.

They all fell into two camps:
Camp 1: Dead Storage

    Entries without patterns discovery/actionables

    Low intelligence, bad ux

Camp 2: Generic Chatbots

    “AI-powered!” but it’s just ChatGPT

    Low transparency about the context, not really focused on the user life

    Might as well use regular ChatGPT

Egovex is different

    Context-obsessed → Uses your real history

    Decision-focused → Tracks dilemmas + deadlines

    Proactive → “You mentioned burnout 5 times this week”

    Alignment-measured → Actions vs values

    Pattern detection → Finds invisible connections

The goal isn’t productivity.

    Productivity apps help you do more things.

    Egovex helps you do the right things.
